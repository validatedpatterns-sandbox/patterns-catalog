    longDescription: >
      This pattern demonstrates a horizontal solution for multicluster DevSecOps use cases.
      It is derived from the multi-cloud GitOps pattern with added products to provide a complete DevSecOps workflow.

    description: A horizontal solution for Industrial Edge use cases
    longDescription: >
      This pattern demonstrates a horizontal solution for Industrial Edge use cases. It is derived from the MANUela
      work done by Red Hat Middleware Solution Architects in Germany in 2019/20.
      The name MANUela stands for MANUfacturing Edge Lightweight Accelerator, you will see this acronym in a lot of artifacts.
